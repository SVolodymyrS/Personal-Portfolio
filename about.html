    <p><u><b>Hello everyone.I want to tell a little about my path and my hobby:</b></u> I studied to be an electrical
        engineer, diving deep into circuits, systems, and the power behind technology. But
        even as I pursued that path, my fascination with the digital world grew. I wasn’t just interested in how things
        worked; I was captivated by how technology could shape experiences. Web design, with its blend of creativity and
        logic, drew me in. So, I decided to expand my skill set, teaching myself how to design and code websites. Now,
        I’m blending both worlds—using my engineering background to create sleek, efficient, and functional web designs.
